These are the features we have working:

	All the basic animation controls: Pause/Play/Speed/Looping/Restart
	Selecting Shapes and Keyframes

These sort of work:

	Modifying Keyframes (Updates references but animation doesn't always reflect the changes made)
	Adding Shapes (Updates the model but doesn't show up on the JList)
	Adding Shapes (Same issue)
	Adding Keyframes (Doesn't work if adding to a tick after end of animation)
	Deleting keyframes (Updates references but doesn't show how animaiton is displayed, also throws a lot of errors and I don't know why)

We'll work to fix the problems ASAP
