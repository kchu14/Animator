Review of Experience:
We felt that this assignment was much harder for us than many of our classmates. We talked to
other groups and they explained that the code that they received was implemented and designed
much better and that made it easier to adapt to their models. Our providers were nice and
responsive, but that did not help when their code was incomplete. Furthermore, our providers
were working on finishing assignment 7 up until a day before the assignment was due.

As far as our code goes, we think we had a decent design structure in regards to delegation
and things we discussed in class. It definitely would have been easier if we structured our data
as a map of motions where the key was the time instead of storing those motions as a list. That
would have made it easier to find the correct motion and modify it. Additionally, restructuring our
motion data to be in the form of keyframes was not implemented in a efficient way. Looking back,
it would have been worth it to convert to keyframes from the start.
